                <h3>Our history</h3>
                    <p>Fultum Wiltshire was been inspiring men, women and organisations to donate their time and funding to assist
                     the people of Wiltshire, for over 100 years.  The determined and devoted force behind the 
                    organisation has been our founder Lady Elspeth Fitzgerald. A very charismatic, big-hearted person and most generous 
                    soul, our 'Lady E' left her country estate to the Fultum Wiltshire community support organisation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our name 'Fultum' is taken directly from the Latin word (of middle English origin), and its meaning is 'to help; 
                        support; and protect'.
                    </p>

                <h3>How you can help?</h3>
                <h4>Donating or volunteering as an Organisation</h4>
                <p>“A recent study found that if given the choice between two companies which offered services or 
                products at the same price, 82% would be influenced by whether the company was philanthropic.”
                </p>
                <p>“Other studies have shown that Millennials are 70% more likely to spend more on brands that support causes, 
                so it is certainly worth considering the impact of your business’s relationship with charities.”
                </p>
                <p><em>source: https://magazine.dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2018/08/21/five-reasons-why-supporting-charity-benefits-business/</em>
                </p>
                <h4>Benefits to your Organisation include:</h4>
                <p>Defining your brand identity and marketing reach:  the charitable contributions of your busines can position you as reliable,
                ethical and supportive of your local community. Also makes jobs at your organisation more attractive.
                And of course it has a positive effect to the charity's purpose.
                </p>
                <p>Boosts employee morale: An organisations support of charitable causes leads to increased positivity and provide
                amongst employees, possible leading to better staff loyalty and retention.  Some employees may have a particular
                charity they support but don't the personal time or capacity to support them and offering a work-based charitable
                 scheme (for example, volunteering a set number of days in a year) will encourage commitment and a sense of wellbeing.

                <h4>Benefits to individuals</h4>
                    <p>Make a difference: volunteering has a very real and positive effect on both you and the person you're
                    supporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Meet new people and be part of a community: volunteering is a great opportunity to network with different
                    people and be a part of something both valuable and beneficial to all.
                    </p>
                    <p>Learn new skills:  volunteering is a great way to gain work experience and could also show your passion 
                    or talent for a particular area.  Some of our volunteers have gone on to be teachers, lecturers and fund-raisers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Have fun and enjoy yourself:  interacting with and helping someone else leads to greater self-confidence and of 
                    course a tremendous feeling of self-fulfilment and satisfaction.
