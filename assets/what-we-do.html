                <p>With our different support methods: one-to-one, groups and online support - we have something that will suit 
                everyone.</p>
                <p>Our services are driven by our passionate volunteers, leading to real benefits for our members that result in 
                a better quality of life and improvement in general health and wellbeing.

                <h3>Supporting people and communities</h3>
                <h4>Companionship</h4>
                <p>While our companionship services are individually tailored, the overall intention is to provide practical
                assistance to our members with tasks such as collecting shopping, repeat prescriptions, or the post, and perhaps 
                walking the dog.  We also offer home visits for company, friendship and to ensure you are safe and well.
                </p>
                <h4>Community transport</h4>
                <p>Some of our older population may struggle to get around due to lack of transport or challenges with public
                transport. Fultum Wiltshire provides a shuttle service to help you get to where you need to be, thereby enabling 
                you to be more independent and stay active and social within your community.
                </p>
                <h4>Short term support</h4>
                <p>Our short term support can help with specific things like bereavement, self-esteem issues, self-harm or neglect,
                addiction and how best to cope with loneliness.
                </p>
                <h4>Support for those everyday challenges</h4>
                <p>We offer assistance via our fun workshops teaching things like budgeting skills, interview tips, basic 
                computer skills and independent living tips.
                </p>

                <h3>Book swop and donation scheme</h3>
                <p>We offer a free book swop scheme where members can 'read and return' books from our library. We also 
                    provide a reading service delivered by our volunteers either in your home or in our library lounge. 
                    Additionally, we have a variety of large print books, braille books and audio options.
                </p>
                <p>And of course, we would be delighted to receive any books you may wish to donate to our library.
