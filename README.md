### Design of the Fultum Wiltshire Charity website

#### Colour Scheme
The colour palette chosen consists of four basic colours:  #ce5108 (orange); #0463bb (blue); #ffca4b (yellow); and #80000 (maroon). The body text colour is mostly #3a3a3a (dark grey) with some sections in #000000 (black), and other sections in #ffffff (white).  The colours were chosen to compliment each other and provide the necessary contrast. The colour palette was developed using **Coolors**.

#### Fonts
The logo is using **Shadows Into Light**; all headings are using **Roboto**; and the body text is using **Poppins**.  The back-up font is **sans-serif**.  Fonts were downloaded from **Google Fonts**.

#### Imagery, Icons, Links, Video
Images for the website have been downloaded from **Pexels**.  The social media icons were downloaded from **Font Awesome**.  Some of the links were created using **Bootstrap**. The MP4 video was downloaded from **All Free Downloads**.

### Limitations
As there is no JavaScript functionality present in this website, the Query Form on the 'About Us' page will not receive and store data.
This results in a browser error message when the 'submit' button is pressed.

### Features
* Newsflash animated banner - displays for 2.5 seconds on opening of 'Home' page.
* The Query Form - this can be completed on the 'About Us' page.  It can also be accessed via the 'Contact Us' link displayed at the top right of the 'What We Do', 'Get Social' and 'About Us' pages - and from the navigational menu.
* Masonry Gallery - visible on the 'Get Social' page.  It can also be accessed from a link on the 'Home' page, as well as the navigational menu.
* Embedded video - this video is controlled by the user and is not set to automatically play.

## Technologies
* HTML - the structure of this website project uses HTML as the main language.
* CSS - the styling of this website encompasses custom written CSS.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - utilised for some of the links within this website.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - utilised for the logo (Shadows Into Light); the headings (Roboto) and the body text (Poppins).
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - utilised for the social media icons.
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - utilised for the colour palette design.
* [All Free Downloads](https://all-free-download.com/free-footage/) - utlised for the MP4 video.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - hosting site for storage of source code for the website and [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the deployment of the website.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - used as version control software to commit and push code to a GitHub repository where all source code is located.
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - these are built in developer tools used to inspect page elements (eg. responsive design); debug issues; and test different CSS styling options.
* [balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - used to create wireframes for the 'Skeleton Plane' of User Experience Design.

## Testing
* This is a static website with no back-end functionality - therefore testing will be performed on visual effect and website layout. 
* Testing will be performed to check for compatibility across three web browsers (Google Chrome; Firefox; and Opera) 
* Responsive design will be tested across the different screen sizes: desktop/laptop (1200px and below); tablet (950px and below); and mobile phone (430px and below).
* All navigational links should direct to the correct html web page as per their names.  The exception here is the 'Home' page, as it will redirect to 'index.html'.
* All links to external websites are to open in a new browser page.
* Testing of the 'Query Form' to ensure correct field input, and that all required fields are completed. 
* Testing of the video link to ensure the user has to click 'play' to run the video and that the video does not play automatically upon opening of the web page.

### Test Cases
Test cases can be found [here](assets/images/fultum-wiltshire_test-cases.jpg)

### Code Validation
All HTML pages were run through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and showed no errors.<br>
The CSS stylesheet was run through the [CSS Validation Service-Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and showed no errors.<br>

### Issues found during testing
* Query form submission:  upon clicking the 'submit' button, the inputted data should be 'posted' to an external database.  This is not occurring due to the web site limitation of no JavaScript functionality.
* Testing across Chrome, Firefox and Opera:  In the Opera mobile screen view of the 'Home' page, the 'How can we support you' box slightly overlaps the above main image.  Readability and usability of this page is not affected by this box overlap.

## Deployment
### Project Creation
The project was created using GitHub and choosing a new [repository](https://github.com/ColetteThomson/Fultum-Wiltshire-Charity).<br>
The following terminal commands were used during this project:
* git add . - this command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
* git commit -m "*message*" - this command details the change/s made in the 'message' section and then commits the changes to the local repository.
* git push - this command is used to push all changes to the GitHub repository.

### Using GitHub Pages
* Navigate to the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ColetteThomson/Fultum-Wiltshire-Charity).
* Select 'Settings'.
* Scroll down to 'GitHub Pages'.
* Select 'Main' branch as the source and click 'Save' button.
* Select link to go to live published page.
